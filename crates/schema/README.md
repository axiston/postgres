Contains the database schema for the application, generated using
[diesel_cli][diesel_cli].

The schema is updated automatically after all migrations are applied during a
GitHub Action triggered by a pull request to the `main` branch. For instructions
on how to regenerate the schema locally, refer to the `Makefile` in the project
root and `build.rs` files.
