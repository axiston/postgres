A standard PostgreSQL 17 Docker image with all project-required extensions,
migrations, and a database client including a generated schema.

#### Notes

- See the [official Postgres image] for more details on PostgreSQL configuration
  and features.
- If you already have a running PostgreSQL instance that you want to use with
  this service, you must install, configure, and enable the required extensions
  before starting the gateway. Refer to the [Dockerfile][dockerfile] for
  details.

#### Dependencies

- Uses [diesel][diesel] as an objectâ€“relational mapping and
  [diesel_migrations][diesel_migrations] for database migrations.
- Depends on [diesel_async][diesel_async] for asynchronous connections and
  [diesel_derive_enum][diesel_derive_enum] to streamline enum handling.

#### Guidelines

- Migrations are append-only. Once a migration is merged into the `main` branch,
  do not modify it.
- Migrations in `migration/` must be idempotent, ensuring they can be run
  multiple times without causing issues.
- Self-hosted service users should update role passwords manually after running
  all migrations.
- Production releases are created by publishing a new GitHub release from the
  `main` branch.
